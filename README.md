# AllerGEN
AllerGEN is web based app that allows people with allergies to scan food nutrition labels to find out if the product contains a specific allergen. All you need to do is take a picture of your nutrition label and upload it onto our upload page. Our website will ask you what to look out for specific to your allergies.

This project was submitted for the HackGT9 Event, and [here](https://devpost.com/software/allergen-5a7vy0) is the Devpost submission of our project.
