# AllerGEN

AllerGEN is web based app that allows people with allergies to scan food nutrition labels to find out if the product contains a specific allergen. All you need to do is take a picture of your nutrition label and upload it onto our upload page. Our website will ask you what to look out for specific to your allergies.

This project was originally submitted for the HackGT9 Event, and [here](https://devpost.com/software/allergen-5a7vy0) is the Devpost submission of our project.

## Updates (May 2024)
I've gone back and tinkered with this project a bit more! I've now deployed the frontend of our project using [Vercel](https://vercel.com), and I've deployed the backend using a Docker image on [Render](https://render.com). 

Unfortunately, since I'm using the Free tier of Render's services, the API requests to the backend take a *really* long time to resolve. *However*, I've tested the backend using [Postman](https://postman.com), and I promise it works! For better performance, we will need more compute power.
